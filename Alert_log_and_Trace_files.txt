Alert log is a continuous stream of messages regarding critical and informational updates affecting the instance and the database. Only events that are considered to be very important are logged including startup and shutdown sequences, changes to the physical structures or changes to parameters that control the instance. Trace files then are generated by background processes when they detect error conditions and sometimes to report certain actions

SYS @ sandpit > show parameter background_dump
NAME                                 TYPE        VALUE
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------------------------
background_dump_dest                 string      /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0
                                                 /diag/rdbms/sandpit/sandpit/trace
bash-4.1$ alias|grep trc
alias trc='tail -50 /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/diag/rdbms/sandpit/sandpit/trace/alert_sandpit.log'

The alert log is a continuous record of database operation applied to the instance and the database. Its location is determined by instance parameter background_dump_dest and its name is alert_${SID}.log where SID is the name of the instance. 

It records all critical operations including startup and shutdown commands and internal errors along with any operations which may affect the physical structure of the database. e.g. all log switches and log archives.

The alert log for a startup shows all non-default initialisation parameters.
