Oracle - How to check if Physical Standby is in sync with Primary
-----------------------------------------------------------------

************** Run the queries below on Primary database: **************

# check the max log sequence on Primary DB
SELECT Max(sequence#) 
FROM   v$log_history; 

# identify the last sequence generated on Primary DB
SELECT thread#, 
       Max(sequence#) "Last Primary Seq Generated" 
FROM   v$archived_log 
WHERE  first_time BETWEEN ( SYSDATE - 1 ) AND ( SYSDATE + 1 ) 
GROUP  BY thread# 
ORDER  BY 1; 


************** Now run the following queries below on Standby database: **************

# double-check that you are on Standby database - the query below should return "mounted"
SELECT status FROM   v$instance; 

# check the max log sequence
SELECT Max(sequence#) 
FROM   v$log_history;

# check the last log received from Primary DB
SELECT thread#, 
       Max(sequence#) "Last Standby Seq Received" 
FROM   v$archived_log 
GROUP  BY thread# 
ORDER  BY 1; 

# check the last log applied
SELECT thread#, 
       Max(sequence#) "Last Standby Seq Applied" 
FROM   v$archived_log 
WHERE  applied = 'YES' 
GROUP  BY thread# 
ORDER  BY 1; 

Now compare the max log sequence on Primary DB with "Last Standby Seq Received" and "Last Standby Seq Applied" to see if there is a gap.
