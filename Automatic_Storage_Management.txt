Datafiles can exist on four types of devices:
local filesystems,
clustered file systems,			* usually to do with implementing RAC
raw devices,				* only a historical anomaly really
files on ASM devices.			* alternative to file system based storage.

In summary ASM is a logical volume manager provided by Oracle and bundled with the database. The idea is that you take a raw disk, give them to oracle and let oracle get on with it. System administrators need not worry about creating file systems at all. ASM is a logical volume manager designed for oracle database files however it cannot be used for all files (It cannot be used for the ORACLE_HOME or for the alert log or trace files. 

## To check out ASM rebalance operation progress...
select group_number, operation, state, power, actual, sofar, est_work, est_rate, est_minutes
from v$asm_operations; 


## To query the existing disk groups and disks 
select group_number, disk_number, mount_status, name, path
from v$asm_disk
order by group_number, disk_number; 


## To check out the members of a disk group
select dg.name diskgroup, dg.type, d.disk_number, d.name asmdisk, d.failgroup, d.path
from v$asm_diskgroup dg join v$asm_disk d using (group_number) 
where dg.name = '+DATA1'; 


## To create a new tablespace 
SQL> create tablespace DATA_STUFF datafile '+DATA1'; 


## To check out rebalancing operation
SQL> select group_number, operation, state, power, actual, sofar, est_work, est_rate, est_minutes from v$asm_operation; 


## To change the rebalance power 
SQL> Alter diskgroup DAT4_01 rebalance power 10; 


-- Dont forget the ASMCMD utility 
asmcmd> ls -l
asmcmd> pwd
asmcmd> lsdg    # list disk groups 
asmcmd> lsdsk   # list disks
asmcmd> cp spfiledw.ora /tmp/BACKUPspfiledw.ora
