In oracle, restore and recover have two special but distinct meanings. To restore a datafile is to extract it from backup and return it to the place where it was made. If a datafile is damaged or missing, a restore operation will replace it with the copy from backuo. But the restored file will be out of date with the rest of the database; so to recover the file, the relevant change vectors are extracted from the redo log stream and applied to bring the file forward in time until it is synchronised with the rest of the database.
