Example: In the example that follows, our starting value is a string, ‘$17,000.23’. 
This isn’t a numeric datatype but a character string containing a dollar sign and a comma.
 The format model here explains that the dollar sign is a symbol, and the format model makes 
 it clear where the significant numeric data can be found in the source column.
  The “9” element below is not a literal number 9, but rather an element of the format model 
  that indicates the presence of any digit. It is repeated to indicate the upper bound of
   acceptable values. Finally the output is displayed—a raw numeric value extracted from
    the character string ‘$17,000.23’.
    
    
  SELECT TO_NUMBER('$17,000.23','$999,999.99')
  FROM   DUAL;
  TO_NUMBER('$17,000.23','$999,999.99')
  ------------------------------------
  17000.23
