Data can be restricted using a where clause but for further refinement, booleanor logical operators 
should be used in order to further refine the data extraction.

These are the 'AND' and 'OR' operators.   

AND
1  select last_name,first_name from employees
  2  where commission_pct is null
  3  and
  4* last_name like 'A%'
HR @ sandpit > /

LAST_NAME                 FIRST_NAME
------------------------- --------------------
Atkinson                  Mozhe
Austin                    David


OR
Conforming to just one OR condition is enought for a record to be returned.

  1  select * from jobs where
  2  Job_title = 'Langer'
  3  or
  4* job_title = 'Programmer'
HR @ sandpit > /

JOB_ID     JOB_TITLE                           MIN_SALARY MAX_SALARY
---------- ----------------------------------- ---------- ----------
IT_PROG    Programmer                                4000      10000

1 row selected.


NOT 
The not operator can be used to reverse the boolean matching so..
where last_name like 'King'... can be changed to... where last_name not like 'King'
where last name like 'King'... can be changed to... where not (last_name ' King')
where dept_id in (10,20,30)... can be changed to... where dept_id not in (10,20,30)
