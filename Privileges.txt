=============================
To grant and Revoke Privileges
=============================
By default no-one can do anything in oracle even if they have a user account. A user cannot connect without being granted a privilege. And even once this is done, he/she can not do anything else remotely useful until they are granted more privileges. Privileges are assigned to user acocunts with a GRANT command and withdrawn using the REVOKE command. Addiitonal syntax can allow the user to grant any privileges he.she has onto others. Only the adminisistrator accounts have the ability to grant any but the most limited privileges. 

Privileges come in two groups:
1) SYSTEM PRIVILEGES
 - these apply to actions that impact the data dictionary such as creating users or tables. Others affect the database or instance, such as creating tablespaces, adjusting instance parameters or establishing a session. 
For example :
= CREATE SESSION - this lets the user connect
= ALTER DATABASE - allows modification of physical structures
= ALTER SYSTEM - gives control over instance parameters
= CREATE TABLESPACE - lets a user mnaage tablepsaces
= CREATE TABLE - lets the granetee create tables in his/her own schema. inclues ability to alter/drop/select and manipulate indexes on these tables by association
= DROP ANY TABLE  - the grantee can drop tables belonging to other users
= SELECT ANY TABLE - the grantee can select from tables belonging to other users

The syntax for granting a system privilege is

You can also allow a grantee to pass on thieir privilege to others if neccesary. 
e.g. GRANT CREATE TABLE TO scott WITH ADMIN OPTION;
This allows the user to now grant the same privilege to others. 
* if this privilege is revoked from scott, then any users to which scott passed on the privilege will remain intact as it does not cascade back. 

2) OBJECT PROVILEGES
 - Object privileges give the ability to perform select , update , delete and insert commands against tables and related objects. This is not neccessary for the users own schema i.e. if a user has the CREATE TABLE system privilege, then he / she can perform the normal select and DML operations aginst the tables he / she creates naturally.  
The object privileges are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, EXECUTE
For example:
scott @ sandpit > grant select on scott.t1 to scott; 
Grant succeeded.

This will let scott query all columns of scott's t1 table.

The use of the WITH GRANT syntax option also allows the user to pass the object privilege onto others. 
* However for an object privilege - oracle maintains a record of who granted what to whom so this allows a revoke of an object grant to cascade all the way back up to chain. 

 1*  grant insert on scott.t1 to scott with grant option
SYS @ sandpit > /
Grant succeeded.

You can query system privilges via the Data dictionary view: DBA_SYS_PRIVS
SYS @ sandpit > /
GRANTEE                        PRIVILEGE                                ADM
------------------------------ ---------------------------------------- ---
scott                           CREATE PROCEDURE                         NO
scott                           CREATE SESSION                           NO
scott                           CREATE SEQUENCE                          NO
scott                           CREATE VIEW                              NO
scott                           CREATE TABLE                             NO

You can also search for object privileges for a table which is nice!
  1* select * from dba_tab_privs where grantee in ('SCOTT','scott')
SYS @ sandpit > /
