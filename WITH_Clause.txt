-- Interesting use of the WITH clause which is a subquery utility

Allows you to define a subquery or more as you go and post reference these...
Note how I give tow DA_ aliases below and then subsequently select from these...

SQL> WITH
DA_PORTS AS (select port_id from ports),
DA_SHIPS AS (select ship_name, home_port_id from ships)
SELECT  ship_name from DA_SHIPS where DA_SHIPS.home_port_id IN (SELECT * FROM DA_PORTS)

SHIP_NAME
