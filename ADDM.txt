The database comes preconfigured with a set of advisors, see advisor central in Enterprise Manager.
First among these is the ADDM or Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor. ADDM reports are generated automatically whenever an AWR snapshot is tajen. 
The automatically generated ADDM reports cover the period between the current snapshot and the last one. You can invoke the ADDm naually in order to span a greater period between snapshots if neccessary. Reports are purged after 30 days. 

The ADDM usually will make reccomendations around for further performance analysis and problem resolution including directing to other advisors.

E.g 
Memory Advisors : to predict the effect of varying sizes of memory structures
SQL Advisors : SQL Tuning advisor can analyze individual SQL statements in order to suggest rewriting inefficiences. 
UNDO Advisor : this will observe the rate of of undo data generation and the length of queries being run to reccomend a minimum size for the undo tablespace.
MTTR : mean time to recover advisor estimates the period for crash recovery if neccessary
