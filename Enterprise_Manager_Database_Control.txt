The configuration of database control is done at database creation. If there are several database instances running off the same $ORACLE_HOME then each instance will have its own database control instance. To start database control - use the emctl utility. 

emctl start dbconsole 
emctl status dbconsole 
emctl stop dbconsole 

To connect

https://hostname:port:/em
