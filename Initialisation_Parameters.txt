The instance is defined by the parameters used to build it in memory. Some of these parameters can be changed or adjusted after startup. Some are fixed at startup time and can only be changed by shutting down the instance and starting again. 

The parameters used to initially build the instance come from the Pfile or SPfile. Every parameter bar db_name has a default and there are close to 300 which can be set. There are about 1500 altogether but these are hidden and purely for thge purpose of oracle support. Only approximately 33 parameters out of the 300 or so are considered basic. 

To view the parameters and their current values - 

  select name, value from v$parameter ;
  select name,value from v$spparameter ;

The difference in the above views is that the first queries the parameter values currently in effect in the running instance. The second shows the value of parameters in the spfile on disk. Uusally these will be the same but sometimes not. Some parameters can be changed whilst the instance is running but some known as static parameters are fixed at instance startup. 

You can change the instantly modifiable parameters which will have an immediate effect and they can optionally be written out to the spfile also. This means the change will be permanent and the next time the instance is topped and started, the change will be in effect. If this is not done, the change will be forgotten when the instance is restarted. To change a static parameter - the change must be written out to the spfile and will come into effect when the instance is next restarted. 

To see the values in effect from the spfile and whats in memory:

select p.value, s.value
from v$parameter p join v$spparameter s
 on p.name=s.name

To see what parameters are indictaed as being or a "basic" type?
