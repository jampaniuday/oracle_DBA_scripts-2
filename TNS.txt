To test a connect string in Oracle (An oracle net alias) - use TNSPING.

This will accept a string, locate the Oracle Net files , resolve the string and send a message to the listener. If the listener is running and does know about the service requested, the test will return successfully. .

------------ Note below how the listener has a number of supported services and instances....

-bash-4.1$ lsnrctl services

The command completed successfully

------------ Then we can check the Oracle Net aliases defined in the local naming file TNSNAMES>ORA...
-bash-4.1$ cat tnsnames.ora 
# tnsnames.ora Network Configuration File: /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0/db_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora
# Generated by Oracle configuration tools.

SANDPIT =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = solaris11)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SID = sandpit)
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
    )
  )

SANDY =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = solaris11)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVICE_NAME = sandpit.ardfield)
    )
  )

------------ Now if we try to run tnsping against both of the oracle Net connect strings (remember these can be anything but for sanity sake it is easier just to keep them in line with the instance_name or SID)...

-bash-4.1$ tnsping SANDY
