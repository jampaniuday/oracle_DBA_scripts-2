The SYSDBA and SYSOPER system privileges allow access to a database instance even when the database is not open. Control of these privileges is totally outside of the database itself.
 
If a DBSA needs to start a database which is down – he needs to authenticate using the Oracle password file or through the operating system.  The default location is $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/orapw${ORACLE_SID}.
 
The Oracle orapwd command line utility assists the DBA with granting SYSDBA and SYSOPER privileges to other users.  By default, the user SYS is the only user that has these privileges that are required to use orapwd.  Creating a password file via orapwd enables remote users to connect with administrative privileges through SQL*Net. The key here is that a remote user not ssh’ed into the server can remotely connect” as sysdba” privilege.
 
You can create a password file using the below syntax.
orapwd file=<name of password file> password=<password for sys user>
 
You can see the required help page by entering
orapwd help=y
 
The password file parameter remote_login_passwordfile can be set to different values.
 
SYS @ DB1 > show parameter password
NAME                                 TYPE        VALUE
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------------------------
remote_login_passwordfile            string      EXCLUSIVE
 
Exclusive means that the password file can can only be used by that one database and it can have multiple users contained within.
 
When set to shared – the password file can be used by multiple databases yet only the SYS user is recognised.
 
Whenever SYSDBA or SYSOPER privileges are given to another user – their details are added to the password file.
