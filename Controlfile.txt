The controlfile contains pointers to the rest of the database. The locations of the redo log files and the data files, and of the more recent archive log files if it is in archive log mode. It also stores information required to maintain database integrity , i.e. various critical sequence numbers and timestamps. Multiplexing the controlfile means to have created multiple copies. If one copy is damaged, the database can survive; oracle itself takes care of ensuring that the controlfile copies are synchronised and its maintenance is automatic.

SYS @ sandpit > select * from v$controlfile;

If a control file is removed or deleted - the instance will stop or not start displaying the below.

ORA-00210: cannot open the specified control file
ORA-00202: control file: '/u03/oradata/sandpit/control03.ctl'
ORA-27037: unable to obtain file status
Solaris-AMD64 Error: 2: No such file or directory

You can recover the situation by copying an existing control file into place as neccessary.

You need to locate the location of the missing file and one of the existing files. E.g.
bash-4.1$ strings spfilesandpit.ora | grep -i ctl 
files='/u01/oradata/sandpit/control01.ctl','/u02/oradata/sandpit/control02.ctl','/u03/oradata/sandpit/control03.ctl'

Then copy any of the existing control files to overwrite the missing copy.
