Merge statements::
 
The merge command is often ignored but can be useful in that in one pass through, it can carry out all three (updated, insert, delete) operations.
 
merge into employees using new_employees
on (employees.employee_id = new_employees.employee_id
when matched then update set employees.salary = new_ employees.salary
when not matched then insert (employee_id, last_name, salary) values (new_ employees.employee_id, new_ employees.last_name, new_ employees.salary);
