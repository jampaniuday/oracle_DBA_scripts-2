Statspack is a set of performance and reporting utilities provided by oracle. it has been superceded by AWR reporting and automatic database diagnostic monitoring but can still be useful.

You also need to be licensed to use the diagnostic pack in order to use AWR and ADDM.

To install statspack - run the scripts below to drop the user firstly and then recreate the perfstat user schema.

cd $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin
sqlplus "/ as sysdba" @spdrop.sql       -- Drop and install statspack
sqlplus "/ as sysdba" @spcreate.sql     -- Enter tablespace names when prompted


To take a performance snapshot manually:
PERFSTAT @ sandpit > exec statspack.snap;
PL/SQL procedure successfully completed.

To automate the execution of statspack snaps, you can use the spauto.sql script located in the directory above.
$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/spauto.sql

 -- To get a list of current snapshots available:
PERFSTAT @ sandpit > select SNAP_ID, SNAP_TIME from STATS$SNAPSHOT; 
   SNAP_ID SNAP_TIME
---------- ---------
         1 08-MAR-14
         2 08-MAR-14
         3 08-MAR-14


In order to execute the statspack report...
bash-4.1$ sqlplus / as sysdba @$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/spreport.sql 

And fill in the relevant snapshot ids to define how long you want the window of examination to be. The report will be output in a text format.
