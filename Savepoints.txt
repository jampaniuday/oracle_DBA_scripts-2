SAVEPOINT::


The use of savepoints is to allow a programmer the ability to set a marker within a transaction that can be used to control the effect of a rollback i.e. to a certain point only. 

SAVEPOINT namegoeshere;

This creates a point in the transaction that can be used in subsequent rollback commands. 


truncate table TAB;
insert into TAB values ('one');
savepoint first;
insert into TAB values ('two');
savepoint second;
insert into TAB values ('three');
savepoint third;
rollback to savepoint first;
commit;

-- in this case, the tAB table will be left with only one row inserted in it.
