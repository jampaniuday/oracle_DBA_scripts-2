The RMAN recovery catalog is a database schema that holds the metadata detailing RMAN backup operations performed on a target database. The metadataa includes the following info : db structure, rman config, data file and archive log backups, backup sets, pieces and copies, archived redo logs and copies. 

To create a RMAN recovery catalog - follow the below steps:

# First create a tablespace to house the recovery catalog schema

SYS @ catalog > create tablespace catalog_TS 
  2  datafile '/u02/oradata/catalog/catalog_TS01.dbf' size 100M autoextend off
  3  logging 
  4  online 
  5  permanent 
  6  extent management local uniform size 1M
  7  segment space management auto;

Tablespace created.

SYS @ catalog > select tablespace_name from dba_tablespaces;

TABLESPACE_NAME
------------------------------
SYSTEM
SYSAUX
UNDOTBS1
TEMP
USERS
CATALOG_TS


# Next create the catalog owner - this cannot be SYS
SYS @ catalog > list
  1  create user rcat identified by rcat
  2    default tablespace catalog_TS
  3    quota unlimited on catalog_TS
  4*   temporary tablespace temp

SYS @ catalog > /
User created.

# Grant this user the special recovery catalog owner priviliges.
SYS @ catalog > grant recovery_catalog_owner to rcat ;
Grant succeeded.

# Now the user should have all it needs in order to manage the manage and maintain the recovery catalog.
SYS @ catalog > select privilege from dba_sys_privs where grantee='RECOVERY_CATALOG_OWNER';

# The actual creation of the recovery catalog is performed in rman whilst connected to the database in which the catalog is to live. The create catalog command will create the catalog in the default tablespace of the user.

The connect is important:
-bash-4.1$ rman target / catalog rcat@catalog
