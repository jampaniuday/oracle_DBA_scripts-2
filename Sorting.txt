Order by clause is always the last clause in a select statement 

Ascedning order is the deafult :
HR @ sandpit > select last_name from employees order by last_name;

LAST_NAME

Ande
Atkinson
Austin
Baero


or you can order in reverse by 
HR @ sandpit > select first_name, last_name from employees order by last_name desc;

* Oracle offers a little shorthand mechanim called positional sorting in order to efectively sort by column or expression instead of specifying the column name. 
Instead of:
HR @ sandpit > select * from regions order by region_id desc;

 REGION_ID REGION_NAME
---------- -------------------------
         4 Middle East and Africa
         3 Asia
         2 Americas
         1 Europe
You can use...
HR @ sandpit > select * from regions order by 1 desc;

 REGION_ID REGION_NAME
---------- -------------------------
         4 Middle East and Africa
         3 Asia
         2 Americas
         1 Europe

Composite sorting is also possible so you can sort by one column and then subsort by another column...
  1  select first_name, last_name from employees
  2* order by first_name asc, last_name desc
HR @ sandpit > /

FIRST_NAME           LAST_NAME
