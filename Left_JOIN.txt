LEFT OUTER JOIN

Another type of join is called an Oracle LEFT OUTER JOIN. This type of join returns all rows from the LEFT-hand table specified in the ON condition and only those rows from the other table where the joined fields are equal (join condition is met).

SYNTAX

The syntax for the Oracle LEFT OUTER JOIN is:

SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT [OUTER] JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
In some databases, the LEFT OUTER JOIN keywords are replaced with LEFT JOIN.

VISUAL ILLUSTRATION
The Oracle LEFT OUTER JOIN would return the all records from table1 and only those records from table2 that intersect with table1.
